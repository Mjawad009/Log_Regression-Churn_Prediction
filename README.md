Logistic Regression: Churn Prediction
This project demonstrates how to use Logistic Regression to build a binary classification model that predicts customer churn using a real-world dataset.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Understand and apply logistic regression for binary classification.

Preprocess and normalize data for machine learning.

Train and evaluate a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.

Interpret model performance using metrics such as log-loss.

Visualize key insights from the dataset.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available at ChurnData.csv above.

This dataset includes features such as customer account length, international plan, number of calls, charges, and a binary churn label (1 = churned, 0 = retained).

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib for data visualization

Scikit-learn for model training, preprocessing, and evaluation

ðŸš€ Steps Performed
Data Loading & Inspection
Load data directly from a remote URL, inspect for nulls and structure.

Feature Selection
Select relevant features for the logistic regression model.

Preprocessing

Convert categorical to numerical (if any).

Normalize features using StandardScaler.

Train-Test Split
Data split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Training
Logistic regression model trained with sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.

Prediction & Evaluation

Predictions made on test data

Log-loss metric used to evaluate prediction confidence.

Visualization
Generate plots to analyze feature importance and model results (if applicable).

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metric
Log Loss: Used to evaluate probabilistic classification performance, especially suitable for imbalanced datasets.
